# Bank-Loan-Analysis-Visualization
Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to monitor and assess the bank’s lending activities, performance, and loan portfolio health across multiple KPIs.

Built Summary, Overview, and Detail Dashboards to visualize KPIs such as Total Loans, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Avg. Interest Rate, and Avg. DTI.

Developed Good vs Bad Loan KPIs and implemented Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) trend analysis.

Used multiple visuals — line, map, bar, and tree charts — for regional, purpose-based, and term-based insights.

Dashboard as follows:
